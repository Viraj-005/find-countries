# Country Information Finder üåç

This web application allows users to select a country from a dropdown list and view detailed information about it, such as the country‚Äôs capital, population, area, and more. The app also displays the country's location on an interactive map.

## Features
- Fetches data from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to provide details on countries.
- Displays information like official name, capital, region, population, area, and more.
- Integrates with Google Maps to show the selected country‚Äôs location on the map.
- Uses PHP and Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Setup and Installation

```

### 2. Install PHP (if not installed)
Make sure you have PHP installed. You can verify by running:
